        <description><![CDATA[You attempt to send one creature that you can see
within range to another plane of existence. The
target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw
or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re
on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane.
While there, the target is incapacitated. The target
remains there until the spell ends, at which point the
target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence
than the one you’re on, the target is banished with
a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane.

If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the
target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise,
the target doesn't return.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 4th.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the
duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose
the nature of the curse from the following options:

* Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
* While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
* While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
* While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM’s
option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but
it should be no more powerful than those described
above. The DM has final say on such a curse’s effect.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration,
up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or
higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of
7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use
a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.
Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration
that doesn’t require concentration.]]></description>

ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and

When a creature enters the w all’s area for the first
time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the

and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution
saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it
makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell
deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature,
such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw;
it simply withers and dies.

vanish from your current plane of existence and appear
in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is
wasted if you w ere already on that plane). At the start of
your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the
Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of
your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space
you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available
within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied
space (chosen at random if more than one space is
equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear
the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades
of gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60
feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other
creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren’t
there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they
have the ability to do so.]]></description>
